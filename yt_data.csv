@stephanruan1846,"Muhyiddin then was counting his chicken before they were hatched (some lifeless eggs but he includes them as well) ""PAS"" encouraged him to ""PAS""s it on and be counted. Muhyiddin just simply wants the attention and status which go along with being the Prime Minister. There was overwhelming evidence, especially in the award of multi-billion assignments without going through proper tendering procedures including those given directly to within the family circles amounting to $60 billion or more and investigation had started. The Unity Government's role in getting rid of these corrupted top government officers is an uphill task which required great effort. Booting out those irresponsible law enforcers immediately was a correct decision,.otherwise, it will hinder the cleaning process of corruption within the government once and for all to start afresh for a better tomorrow for the country and its people.",2022-12-13T15:51:12Z,0,0,1

There’s a lot of sentiment that choosing PH means choosing DAP and that Islam will be ruined because DAP has many Chinese (even though there are also many Malay representatives in DAP); but isn’t it the same when choosing BN, aren’t you choosing MIC and MCA, and when choosing PN, Gerakan is also chosen? Beside Muhyiddin, there’s a Chinese person standing. Behind Muhyiddin in the poster, there are also two Chinese people beside Muhyiddin and the PAS president. Aren’t you afraid that Islam in Malaysia will be undermined? The son of Tok Guru Nik Aziz, Ustaz Nik Omar, himself chose to run under PH. Whatever it is, I hope when everyone wakes up, they accept and are resigned to the decision of the people who voted. If now you’re happy and proud that PN might form the government, don’t get angry if PH ends up forming the government when you wake up later",2022-11-19T20:01:05Z,0,0,0

@martinlee7102,"“If we care about rising inequality at all, we should be taxing wealth — and therefore capital income — more,” argued Prof Low..Extremely low pre-existing wealth taxation suggests capital owners pay lower taxes than middle-class, whose income is sourced from their labour.Prof Low highlighted that “capital is taxed very lightly” in the Republic, noting that “there is no capital gains tax or inheritance tax”, and that “dividend and interest income are also exempt from personal income tax”..“Property taxes are relatively low, and only rental income is taxed at one’s marginal tax rate,” he added..“Given that the rich,” which Prof Low classified as being “the top 1 per cent” in the income distribution, “derive a significantly larger share of their income from capital, the very low taxes on capital in Singapore means that capital owners may be paying a lower effective tax rate than the (upper) middle class whose main (if not only) source of income is their labour”.",2022-11-19T19:49:25Z,4,0,0

@giant108,GPS & Warisan's top priority is to regain autonomy of education. With this autonomy then it could revive English medium schools as another option. With the introduction of English medium schools it's possible for all Malaysian students to study under the same roof & ground. The prerequisite is Bahasa Malaysia should be made a compulsory subject for all schools. So it's premature for Warisan to be in Peninsula. To call Warisan candidates in Peninsula opportunists is an understatement. Hopefully these opportunists would lose their deposits. All of them in Peninsula.,2022-11-10T01:58:32Z,0,3,0

Malaysia’s Federal Constitution - Article 43(2) provides that the Yang di-Pertuan Agong shall appoint a PM “who in his judgment is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the members of the Dewan the people”. PH has the most seats at GE15 though not reaching 112, PH has the most electorate mandate to form the next government & Anwar Ibrahim be appointed the PM, merely based on “first past the post” principle which is the heart of parliamentary democracy. It’s rubbish to say or as the panels suggested PN, is more popular to form a government, the people(voters) had spoken on 19.11.2022. The voters had given the mandate to PH to form the government whether you like it or NOT, appointing any other candidate other than Anwar Ibrahim would be ANTI-DEMOCRATIC, and would go against of the millions of voters who gave PH’s coalition 82 parliamentary seats!!!

We are clear here that the people rejects corruption and thus, they formed two strong oppositions. However, there are scrutiny on more details that needs further deliberation and this why negotiations is happening at the moment. Whichever govt are formed after this is the result of those scrutiny and as a majority , the coalitions have agreed that they are the better one. This things are not taken likely and has many consideration to make. In the end, you cannot disregard professional's views and thus, the beauty of this traditional structure.",2022-11-20T23:39:23Z,0,,0

Mahathir had to stopped that. Malaysia was one of the county who helped the Palestinian cause, in secrecy, (up to the extent that its a full aid in any means for the Palestinian cause) Mahathir was very verbal about the Palestinian issue during his power, before Abdullah Ahmad Badawi replace him then Najib,  but the information on the Malaysian aids towards Palestinians were leaked to the M055ad, which makes our country a prime target by the West, that's why the West push so hard on us they want to overthrow the Government who helped Palestinians in every means. The wests worked with the opposition, they trained them in propaganda, sabotage campaign, espionage, and intelligence to conduct black ops inside our country they even provide equipments necessaries such as intelligence softwares, neuroweapons to hit on their targets etc etc. Mahathir saw this, so his plan is to defeat the western influence from instilling a puppet government. So now, our people get its power back, Ismail Sabri is the PM of Malaysia. If it wasn't because of Mahathir going into politics again, the west might have already have full control over our country, our intelligence and our Military. Mahathir played a roll as sort of a double agent (you can say) to position himself as the leader of the opposition in the previous election,even though he doesn't agree with most of the oppositions. That was his plan all this while. To wear off the west. And to give some time for our Country to recover and plan to get back our country.",2021-08-28T00:08:56Z,0,0,1

Isn't it?.also under what basis do you use to accuse 'chinese wants to kick us out'? im pretty sure they just want to live equally between other citizens. You just assume out of nowhere they want to 'kick' you. Ironically, its the other way around in many cases isn't it? if they want to kick you they'll bred a lot of children, which mostly they can afford, yet they don't.in fact reality suggest the opposite..",2018-05-23T20:37:25Z,0,,0

Now, mahathir and mahiaddin abahcow jana wibawa split from pakatan harapan and formed perikatan nasional which is this alliance is far more dangerous, racist, extremist to chinese & indian community rather than umno & barisan nasional. Najib, zahid, umno, and barisan nasional never threat chinese & indian community like mahathir, abahcow, perikatan nasional did to these two communities chinese & indian. If perikatan nasional rising to power in future, and pakatan harapan collapse due to its unable to gain support among malays, im pretty sure chinese & indian communities will crying for begging to bring the umno & barisan nasional return to power as bn is the only coalition that historically can gain support among all races in malaysia after they face the super extremist threatened from perikatan nasional and more suffer under pas & bersatu.

@DRIrM-wg7to,"Many people with ulterior motives have grossly underestimated the vigor and brilliance of Tun M. Just look at his track record during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. Many parties including the IMF call him an economic pariah for not taking a bail-out loan from IMF. But his own solution was the saviour for Malaysia. Just give him time and we'll see what he can do to pull Malaysia out of the financial crisis created by the corrupt and kleptocratic PM. .The world stood in awe watching a 93 yo man defeated a 64 yo descendant of one of the country's PM. Changing of the 60 yr government with a bloodless and democratic process of election without foreign interference is exemplary. Even developed nations should learn from him.

Those three actually tried to challenge him inside UMNO.  Where are they now?.The fact that he now ""needs time"" to formulate his much smaller cabinet, gives me the impression that PH didn't really expect to win (?)  In Australia, the opposition party has a constant ""Shadow Cabinet"" ""in case they win"".  If they win, the next day their cabinet is there, ready.  If they don't win, the so-called ""Shadow Ministers"" would literally shadow the actual Ministers wath their every move, and criticise or tell the media what those Ministers are doing wrong.  .Looks like PH is not ready, nor prepared.  Incidentally, your theory on how the ""distribution"" of Ministerial posts sounds plausible.

In the age of Internet, she should search out the statistics of people who are able to afford a home fresh out of college and straight to work. Take a look at without parents handout, how many could afford a home on their own. Do a world wide search. Almost 100% of the people who came out of college and started to work would find it impossible to own their own home in the first 5 years at least of their work life...The government and the opposing group are not doing justice to the people of this country purely because they are not putting enough effort on educating the younger generation with reality.

That is a complete BS! There only has been one government who is calling the shots and that is UMNO/ BN. No one else. BN has been mishandling if not down right  ROBBING  the public finances in a scale that we have never seen before!! Billions of RM are lost and they are not coming back and we are the ones who end up paying for it! Not them!! If it is true that the oppositions parties are also corrupt. then i promise you that they will have already be in prison by now. BN will make sure of that. But they are not.. because they are actually clean...So instead, the government are now enforcing ridiculous laws to eliminate any sense of transparency, check and balance, freedom of speech and freedom of press. Politicians like Rafizi ramli are sentenced to prison for calling out corruption. While the perpetrators are not even being investigated.  WE CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE. ENOUGH!! So yeah, don't say ""both sides are corrupt"", ""doesn't matter who wins"" or ""Its never going to change"". BN want you to feel that way! they want you to give up and do nothing!! ..Wake up! it's not enough to just complain. It not okay to be ignorant in ""politics"".  We can't afford to DO NOTHING !!

@hizzaddinno394,"The world needs to keep an eye on Najib - right now he's engaged in an image rebranding campaign aimed at improving his battered public image. The campaign is elegant, simple and effective at reacquiring Barisan National party members, Malay and youth support. He uses humour to affect a nascent but growing disregard of his (accused) crimes. The campaign's motto is ""Malu apa, bossku?"" which can be translated as ""What have you got to be ashamed of, ma' boss?"". Basically, he's trying to downplay the accusations of high level corruption and also rebrand his image into an image of an average joe's hero. He even goes so far as to ""forgive"" the people of Malaysia for his downfall. And it is working - the Malay mindset is quick to forget and forgive (in that specific order), especially when dealing with powerful, rich or influential individuals, even when they themselves were the ones previously exploited by the individual. Some nice chin-wagging and all's forgiven... Allah save us. It was international shame that brought him down but like a bacteria, he's trying to gain resistance to the antibiotic of corruption.",2019-02-15T10:25:59Z,0,2,0

No problem cannot be resolved if we are willing to sit down and discuss rationally for the benefit of all Malaysians.

Thats why Malaysia are generally peaceful. During Mahathir's time, he changed sleepy Malaysia into one of Asia economic tiger. The landscape change from agriculture base to electronic, technology and manufacturing base. There were less racial tension because he will just shut ppl up. Harsh, but effective. Radicalization was also neutralize, thats why you dont hear any terrorism attacks in malaysia, compared to say our neighbour Indonesia. Despite the racial/religion dynamics in this county, we had economic stability, people are just chill, we feel safe and we are proud. All this change when Mahathir retires. 15 years after that malaysia goes to the dog with a sleepy prime minister (literally). when Mahathir shove the sleepy PM to the side, it was only to be taken over by a kleptocrat. We are seriously tired of all this. But now mahathir is back, he can just stay as long as he is able to.

@kamarudinharun8556,"Which Malaysia is divided?? The ordinary people in the street had long live with each other well. Though there may be some distance between the people, but this is because we have different practices in our culture and religions. But in and of ourselves we know best to work with each other irregardless of the behaviors of institutions. We have dreams of putting our families in good neighbourhood and giving our children in good schools...It's the politicians that are divided, and they are asking us to be the same. Along RACIAL lines. We are made to believe by the politicians that wealth had been unequally distributed because races don't have equal opportunities and inherent wealth. These narratives were then converted into affirmative policies. Policies are structures and structures create culture. Hence that's how we are made to belief that their narratives are true. That for each races to move forward in life we must go along the racial political lines...Listen to this video. Division is among politicians. We are divided because political parties are competing along non democratic lines. ..Our choices and our thoughts are NOT important!! Political scheming by politicians can change whatever choices we may had made during elections...NO!! We are not divided. Politicians you are the one divided and imposing your narratives to further your cause, NOT OURS!!..Malaysians we have no leaders who truly care about us. And say enough is enough Then we, the ordinary people, must see good among each other, believe in each other, align ourselves and then proceed to build our economy by ourselves irregardless of the politicians. It's time that we move pass the word Malaysia, but move to make Malaysia a NATION ( people with common aspiration and common values). The best brain in the country reside among us, not among politicians. We know what we want in our lives and we know what we are truly capable of.

@jp2916,"As a young Malaysian, I hold a deep love and pride for my country and its rich cultural heritage. Despite this, I have been deeply disappointed by the actions and decisions of my government, who are supposed to serve and protect the interests of the country and its citizens. The constant political drama and instability have left me feeling numb and disillusioned. Working overseas has provided me with the necessary perspective to focus on more important aspects of my life, rather than becoming consumed by the disappointing state of my country's politics. I have come to realize that my foreign colleagues possess a better understanding of my country's situation than I do, and while this may be embarrassing, I have simply lost interest and feel disenchanted.",2023-02-12T03:57:45Z,1,3,0
  ↳ @jp2916,"An additional viewpoint:..I deeply respect the significance of religious faith. However, it becomes problematic when it is utilized as a political slogan and one particular race is targeted, such as the Malays in Malaysia. This raises important questions about equality and fairness, like why one culture is given special treatment over others, what happens to the voices and needs of other races and cultures, and why is favoritism so openly practiced causing feelings of discrimination among other races.
.
.If Malaysia truly wants to embrace its claimed multiracial and multicultural identity, then it shouldn't be promoting the interests of just one race or using religion as a political tool. This kind of racial favoritism, even if promised by politicians, only serves to deepen division and segregation.
.
.If, however, the authorities acknowledge that Malaysia is not truly a multiracial and multicultural country, and instead favors one specific race, then I could understand the favoritism. But as it stands, Malaysia claims to be a diverse and inclusive the people, and thus, all races should be treated equally and their cultures celebrated to make Malaysia a rich and thriving country, without one race being elevated above others. I acknowledge that this viewpoint may be a sensitive topic for some, and I apologize for that.",2023-02-12T04:46:39Z,0,,0

He has a lot of knowledge and experiences, well recognized around the world and commands respect by his friends and foes. In a very short period of time since he took office, lots of developments in the political, economic and social arenas have been seen locally and globally as far as Malaysia is concerned. Malaysia cannot afford to be racially divided any longer. Malaysians need to move on in this digital era and modernization. Racial polarity must be seen as an added advantage, not as a dividing factor. Other countries in this region have moved on and developed rapidly, not to mention China of course. Failing to recognize this will make Malaysia soon become 'the sick man of Asia', a derogatory remark once attached to China painfully.",2023-01-31T11:11:13Z,82,2,0

@Windcharger,"Not a lot of insight about the unity government as a result of GE15 apart from Dr. Chandra's viewpoint that PAS strength is only temporary. I also don't understand why CNA gave Mahatir the platform to say that he thinks he still has a good number of supporters when his constituents and every seat contested by his party voted them out. The guy did more harm than good for Malaysia and is responsible for the narrative of hate towards the Chinese by saying that Malays can't do business, the reduction of reserves for pegging the RM against the dollar, introducing a protectionist economy that increased the cost of living and big purchases, such as cars. ..Also, there were no analysis on how Anwar can unite a divided Malaysia. What a lost opportunity. We can see that Malays want an islam-centric and a corrupt-free government. So what can Anwar do to appease and attract these voters and reach out to them and listen to them? Zahid and DAP are baggages, so there must be steps to cut off ties that link corruption to the Unity government. While Anwar constantly blasts about a corrupt-free government, he needs to better show results of good governance. Anwar also needs to reach out to the Malay community who didn't vote for him and ensure that DAP can never hold important ministry positions that matter to the safety and security of the country and Islam. The analyst who said that the trend towards more conservatism in the West is a trend but is partly due to the aging population of those countries who will tend to vote for issues that matter to them. For Malaysia, the movement towards an Islam-centric ideology is due to the divide within public and private/semi-private education and policies that only served urban and politically-connected Malays. The rural Malays are still under-served so they will vote for Islam-centric parties because they are marginalized and ignored and their local mosques are their refuge. We saw how conservative forms of Islam have taken root in other countries. One way of reversing this trend is to educate and give Malay women careers and wealth so they can lose their dependency towards men.",2023-01-29T20:11:44Z,0,0,0

@yummycrepe,"Malaysia politics is very simple and clear. Without the Malays, no one can form the majority government. The root problem lies in the entitlement right of the Malays. Mahathir empowered the Malays hence he used to be loved by them. However he failed on his return as PM. A large group of Malay prefer a government that could prop them up to amassed wealth and power. They are willing to go with anyone that can fulfill their dream. PN is their choice now. Malaysia is not a merit based the people because the people had been conditioned to privilege and entitlement. No matter how well Anwar performs as a PM, he cannot win the heart and mind of this group unless he is able to alter the thinking mentality of this group of people. This is not easy as their belief is deep rooted. In the next election it is either PN will win the majority or a hung parliament again if nothing is being done. .UMNO needs a charismatic leader who can convince and re educate the Malay people that Malay interest will be their number one priority. They need to shift the entitlement mentality to one of merit and recognition of their achievement instead of free hand out. Educating the people is extremely challenging I must say.",2023-01-27T13:56:12Z,26,4,0

It is just common sense and it adds the characteristic of that country. You do not want China to have equal number of Caucasian and Chinese or India to have more Chinese than Indian. Nobody should blame Malaysia for not having a Chinese PM nor should anyone blame Singapore for not having an Indian PM. .Birds flock with birds and sheep with sheep, it is nature and we should respect nature as nature. .Malay is not the major race of the world and so if they so wish to preserve their race, it is their prerogative.

In recent decades, with improving standards of living, significant if not majority number of Malays young and old have started to reject patronage and corrupt politics. ..Malays have also become more conservative and adopting true Islamic practices such as daily prayers, zakat, abstinence from alcohol etc.  Dr Chandra and the likes are not accurate to say Malays are just choosing PN just to reject UMNO. The further rise of conservative Islam just like in the 80s-90s when Malays started to wear Hijab is real and expected. Thus, any government of Malaysia must ensure they respect the needs of this large and growing majority for Malaysia to ensure Islam is a key pillar of the nation. This is possible to be done by ensuring careful balancing between Islam and more secular focus.

Most are non Malays  (Chinese  and Indians). I left and never looked back after I was not allowed to go to Form 6 even tho' I was the top student in my school. The Malay boy who had a miserable Grade 2 in Form 5 got in at Form 6. The braindrain is showing its effect now. One Msian Chinese became the best Mathematic teacher in Australia bcos his teaching skills defy conventional  method of teaching. Another Msian Chinese girl pioneered a discovery in stem cell cancer research in Australia. Recently, a Sarawak Chinese Msian woman became the Foreign  Minister of Australia. My daughter went to Columbia University to complete her Master. Columbia ranked 4th behind Harvard U.  She probably won't  be allowed to go to any Msian university if she is in Msia. Guess why? ..Today, Vietnam is an emerging economy that has  passed Msia which take them only ~ 30 yrs to rise from the Vietnam War. Indonesia which is behind Msia during the early 1980's is slated to be the 5th largest economy in the world. Had already  surpassed Msia. Even Singapore, a small island, beat Msia. The Malay govt administration will never learn the ramifications of the braindrain from Malaysia. In fact, they are so obsessed with Ketuanan Melayu, Bumiputra rights, and marginalized the non-Malays so much that it is practically impossible to change.

There are no other aspects yet. About 1MDB, the PM is indeed deceived but we blame him Many people don’t know that the government has made a lot of efforts for the benefit of all of us. Not every country can provide facilities for its people, but our government provides us with affordable hospitals, primary and secondary schools, food aid, scholarship aid, IPTS/IPTS (higher education), and many other things. This doesn’t even cover other aspects. About 1MDB, the Prime Minister was indeed deceived, yet we blame him without knowing the whole story. Our Prime Ministers have indeed worked to improve our country's economy and provide many facilities for the younger generation. Our PM is actually the one aiming to end ""cronyism, monopoly, and nepotism"" later on. People criticize him without understanding. Some have personal grudges because the PM cut ties with them; they were rich while the people were left struggling. Our PM, however, comes from a noble lineage in Pahang, dating back to the feudal era. I understand that voting is our right, but we should make the right choice so that future generations can enjoy what we have today rather than watching our wealth deplete. My opinion, as a Malaysian, is ""as long as our country is peaceful, let’s continue to support the government.""

BUT that’s a sacrifice we have to make so our children and grandchildren won’t live under poor governance. Let’s endure a bit of hardship now for a greater benefit rather than staying under unsuitable leadership. Once we’re used to changing governments, it will become easier and governments will be more cautious. Many countries do this, but we’re scared. When Singapore separated from Malaysia, things were rough for them, but they were willing to change and work hard, and now they’re a wealthy nation. If we don’t change because it’s “too hard” at first, then the ringgit will keep dropping, our descendants won’t live peacefully, and we’ll resent Najib till the end because we were afraid to change. Let’s choose to struggle now so that we can prosper later, rather than prospering now only to struggle later. Besides, the country has become more chaotic under Najib’s rule.

  ↳ @anwarag263,"there will be changes in the government; that’s inevitable. But we should be grateful that, for now, we can live peacefully in our own country. The government has done a lot for us, but we overlook it and focus on minor faults, forgetting all past contributions. Sure, Singapore is prosperous and wealthy, but do Malays there have competitive strength? The economy is mostly controlled by the Chinese there. Do we really want the special privileges of Malays and the Bumiputra of Sabah and Sarawak to be erased? Have you ever worked under a foreign-owned company? How were you treated? Do you want our beloved country to be ruled by non-Malays? Foreigners are already wealthier than Malays; where does that leave us as Malays and the Bumiputra of Sabah and Sarawak? Do we want foreigners getting rich off our homeland? If we want to progress, we should hold our representatives accountable, not the entire government. If we want progress, it’s simple—send our kids to school, get them into university, and find jobs, whether government or private. Malaysia uses the slogan ""Look East"" (Japan) for a reason. Look at Japan: they’re developed, but their people work hard. They’re diligent; what about us Malays? We’re quick to criticize but slow to be grateful. Other countries envy Malaysia because every state here has development and advancement, even if it’s slow. We blame the government for our children or nephews and nieces not going to school or loitering. But when there’s an economic crisis, we put the blame on the government. I’m not pro-BN, but I’m grateful. My family may not be wealthy, but thank God all my siblings are educated. I hope Sabah has more job opportunities in the future.

  ↳ @herokiryu2652,"@Eddie Ng....Thats what i am saying, rich people have high return because they have a lot of appreciating assets which increase with inflation, when the invest in stock market, their rate of return is more. Poor people however have more depreciating assets and less savings and less investment, in a capitalist system, inflation is proportional to growth, the higher the growth, the more resources consume, the more consumption ,the increase of demand hence increase price. ..Price can be regulated through free market mechanisms or through government policies. Thus the government to regulate the economy through enacted fiscal or monetary policies requires a lot of tax payer reserves. Thus you pay GST, 6% goes to the implementation of Fiscal or Monetary policies, such as regulating currency, China spends 60 billion on regulating its currency. ..What you are complaining is more of the result of a free market system rather than actual Govt incompetence. The reality is that in a capitalist system, you will always make more and more money because the market mechanism is such that it accelerate the income of those who are already wealthy, while those who are poor will always have to cope with this system. ..Thats why education is important, and to have a stable market, where having a skilled labor force is much more important than having the Govt spoon feed you everyday, the Govt can only regulate market mechanisms, but cannot warrant that you do well with your economic situation. So your expectations are unrealistic unless you believe in Communist ideology and Welfare state in which are failing in US and Europe...So please if you think that the alternative Govt takes over, what are they going to do that is so different?",2018-04-18T19:06:38Z,0,,0
  ↳ @whathaff,"It's not 0.1% now is it? Regulating prices through free market should also account exchange rates. Consumer Price Index alone cannot be the driving force of how the inflation has gone through since the implementation of GST. Mamak stalls and those hawkers and sundry shops in villages for example had hiked up their prices upto 20% since 2015, citing GST price issues. Those are places where lower income group patronage. ..Currency regulation needs federal reserves, which is also depleting. Internal economy is driven by jobs creation, and purchasing power is driven by income of the people. If the income increase do not equate the percentage of price of goods hike, you get stale economy...Education - tell me this, have you been to the public schools of late? Have you been to the schools in the rural side of Malaysia? Have you seen the standard of schools there? You are living in an ideal world, where reality of what this country is going through is not sinking in, or you do not see anything outside your tunnel vision. ..GST is unnecessary is there are no wastage in the governing body.  If you have time, please find the latest accounts that was published and you will see the amount of wastage in terms of government spending. So please let's not lecture someone about living in ideal world when you refuse to accept the fact that we are paying too much in Malaysia and not earning enough...I am not one of them, but I have staff that are going through having to make ends meet for their day-to-day needs.",2018-04-18T19:41:30Z,0,,0

I cannot relate that to any data. Infact less Chinese are not going to local schools, they want their own schools, Chinese Schools and Islamic schools. All these merely segregate our communities and isolate the races more and more. Infact if you look at this article....The Chinese have some alternatives to their education, and they can rely on external economies that share same cultural ties, so i dont see how some people think they are oppressed when you have many alternatives. I dont see why you have to complain when you dont even want to go to these schools. The Local schools are not a monopoly, and luckily this country has many alternative education in which you can freely choose. For a Malaysian especially if you are chinese, you have more than enough opportunities for future propects especially with the growing China's economy, so why are you still complaining if Malays want to reserve their economic advantage?..I prefer you reserve your opinions because they are not making an objective assessment, merely your feelings is getting in the way.

One conclusion is clear to anyone with a healthy brain: all the criticism of Mahathir's leadership during his 22 years as Malaysia's Prime Minister is truly 'rubbish talk.' If not, how can you choose the same person as your leader for Prime Minister when you already know he is a dictator, MAHA ZALIM, MAHA FIROUN, abuses ISA, steals money to enrich his family, and so on?

@iansee720,"Whatever excuses, reasons and justifications given by Mahathir, the fact that he promised something (passing the baton to Anwar) and yet not doing it smacks of a total lack of political morality and reasoned judgement. As a  nonagenarian, one would have expected him to mellow into a ""wise knowing advisor"", removed from political bickering and vendetta and enjoying a measure of family life like any other ""normal"" person. Alas, this is not to be. Clearly there were many instances of misjudgements over his long political career which one does not need to list here. One cannot help but wonder about the state of his mental faculty. By not giving him or his (new) party a parliamentary seat, it is sad to see Mahathir being FORCED by the voters into retirement, something which is against the grain of Asian culture, - respect for the elderly.

@djungelskog3434,"Politics isn't supposed to be some competition, politicians are supposed to run for the betterment of their constituents' livelihoods. It doesn't matter which party becomes the majority or wins as long as the one in charge brings the country into prosperity. Unfortunately it seems that our current politicians only have their own self interests in mind, from doing unnecessary renovations to their offices and buying fancy cars to escort them... And let's be honest, if you want to advertise yourself as a multicultural country, maybe you shouldn't put one race above the rest. Otherwise just drop the act. If this was done in the US it would be called out as supremacist immediately. And there never was a democracy here, they'll always find some way to tip the scales in their favor to get back in power, and if you're caught speaking even the slightest insult about the King you go to jail, so much for freedom of speech as well. Royal pardon is literally the 'get out of jail free card' of Malaysian politics. Where is that royal pardon for those who were wrongfully convicted? Furthermore, if you want everyone to be treated equally, you need to have a secular government and not involve your religious agendas. The problem with politics today is that allegiances are fragile and self interest is placed on a higher pedestal than the common folk. Also, Mahatir really needs to stop pointing fingers. No good politician should shift the blame to others as they know fully well that they're responsible for running the whole show. If there's a falling out, it's most likely because he didn't play his cards right. That's all there is. Someone who blames others for their failures and doesn't do any introspection shouldn't run for Prime Minister either. Anwar shouldn't have the seat handed to him because of a promise either. He needs to show us that he's worth our support. Sometimes it just feels like we're just choosing the least worst option out of all parties at times.",2022-06-03T18:47:20Z,3,1,0

@profearoum,"Najib brought significant reforms in governance in Malaysia where government officials and ministers have KPIs where their performance are graded, taxation improved in the form of GST where it would be impossible for rich people and businesses to avoid paying taxes, social security and infrastructure like BR1M and UTC were introduced so that the poor and middle class were aided financially and their lives made easier in a systematic manner without having the need to rely on any persons thus making cronyism much more difficult to implement where every benefit by the government is directly given to citizens without having to go through any political party or individual. During Najib's premiership of 8 years, hundreds of Malay natives became millionaires because of the non-crony capitalism economic policy that Najib implemented. Everything was steadily getting better and getting good in Malaysia, too good, especially freedom of speech that resulted in a lot of lies, political propaganda conspiracy theories and false promises. After 8 years of prosperity, Malaysians especially the Malays have become gullible, arrogant and ungrateful especially the younger generation, and the intensity due to the freedoms personally guaranteed by Najib himself (in his efforts to make Malaysia a developed country) with regards to freedom of speech was capitalized to its fullest by PH, the then opposition during Najib's tenure as Prime Minister. If anything that was Najib's biggest mistake, even in the west today western intellectuals have been trying to improve on the notion of freedom of speech by saying ""freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences"". The hope now is that Najib will learn from his past mistake by being more stern with regards to false allegations and have a team to take these false allegations to court, which is in line with the aspirations of even PH that is the rule of law. But knowing Najib for the type of leader he is, I seriously doubt that he would do that, then my hope is that Malaysian would be wiser and take the extra necessary steps to do their own research before jumping to conclusions at the slightest glimpse of a hyped up basedless controversy just because it's trending on social media.",2022-05-18T16:26:09Z,5,20,0
